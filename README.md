BLEShield_shutter
=================

The BLE shutter control using BLE shield.
This project is based on the Nordic BLE library and the BLE shield V2.0 from RedBearLab.
You can get it from the following link.
https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/ble-sdk-arduino
You can download it and import it into your Arduino environment.

The project has been tested on iphone5 with iOS 7.1.


Note that this function uses the BLE profile called HID over GATT, and it is not supported until iOS7.
Also, iDevices support BLE after iphone4S.
